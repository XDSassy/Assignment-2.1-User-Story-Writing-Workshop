# Sprint 1 Mid-Sprint Checkpoint

## Progress Snapshot
- **Planned points:** 13  
- **Completed points:** 5 (Story #1 fully implemented and tested)  
- **In progress:** 6 points (Story #3: 3 points, Story #5: 3 points partially implemented)  
- **Not started:** 2 points (Story #4: booking cancellation, only UI planned)  
- **Status:** At risk

## At-Risk Work
- **Story #4 – Booking cancellation (2 points):** Delayed start due to dependencies on Story #1 UI integration  
- **Story #5 – Equipment requirements (3 points):** Backend API ready, but frontend UI integration and filtering logic still in progress

## Decisions Taken
- Deferred some advanced equipment filtering features (e.g., multi-select prioritization) to the next sprint to maintain velocity  
- Prioritized completing Story #3 (capacity filtering) before fully integrating Story #5  
- Adjusted test coverage plan: Story #4 automated tests will be added next sprint

## Blockers
- **Resolved:**  
  - Room availability API bug for overlapping bookings (Story #1) fixed by Bob  
  - Calendar UI design clarification received from PO Mapps  

- **Outstanding:**  
  - Equipment filter options finalization for Story #5 (waiting on PO Mapps)  
  - Capacity filter edge case testing (Story #3) in progress

## Team Health
- Team morale is good; everyone is collaborating effectively  
- Minor stress due to dependencies, but daily standups and SM Self facilitation helping track blockers  
- No conflicts reported; workload feels balanced
