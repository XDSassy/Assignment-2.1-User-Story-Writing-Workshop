## Sprint Goal Outcome
**Partially met**  
- Core booking functionality (Story #1) successfully delivered  
- Room capacity filtering (Story #3) mostly implemented  
- Cancellation (Story #4) and equipment requirements (Story #5) partially implemented

## Completed Work

| Story # | Acceptance Criteria Met |
|---------|------------------------|
| 1       | ✓ All criteria met: booking available rooms, confirm booking, view bookings |
| 3       | ✓ Capacity filter working for standard cases; edge cases pending |

## Incomplete Work

| Story # | Reason | Next Action |
|---------|--------|------------|
| 4       | Booking cancellation UI not fully integrated; testing pending | Complete UI integration and automated tests in next sprint |
| 5       | Equipment filtering API ready, but UI integration and multi-select logic incomplete | Finalize frontend integration and additional test coverage in next sprint |

## Sprint Metrics
- **Planned points:** 13  
- **Completed points:** 8 (Story #1: 5 pts + Story #3: 3 pts partially done counted as completed)  
- **Actual velocity:** 8  

## Key Takeaways

- Team collaboration and daily standups were effective in identifying and resolving blockers quickly

## Next Steps
- Complete Story #4 and Story #5 in Sprint 2
