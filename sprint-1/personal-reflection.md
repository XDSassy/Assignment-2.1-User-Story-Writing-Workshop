# Sprint 1 — Personal Reflection

## Key Learning
The most important lesson was that work only counts as complete when it is fully integrated and usable end-to-end, not just implemented in isolation.

## Assumptions That Failed
The assumption that frontend integration and testing would be quick once backend APIs were available proved to be incorrect.

## Behavioural Change
In Sprint 2, I would push for clearer visibility into UI and integration effort before committing to story completion.

## Professional Growth
I need to strengthen my ability to anticipate integration risks and improve estimation accuracy to perform more effectively in a real Scrum team.
