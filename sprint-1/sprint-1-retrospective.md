## Start
- Reviewing UI integration effort during sprint planning
- Identifying technical and dependency risks earlier
- Adding automated tests earlier in the development cycle

## Stop
- Starting dependent stories before prerequisite functionality is fully stable
- Assuming frontend integration will be quick once backend APIs are ready
- Deferring testing until the end of the sprint

## Continue

- Focusing on delivering a stable core booking feature first
- Adjusting scope when risk to the sprint goal becomes clear
