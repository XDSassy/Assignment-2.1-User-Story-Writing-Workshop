# Sprint 1 Summary

Sprint Goal: Enable employees to successfully book and manage conference rooms with capacity and equipment considerations, while allowing cancellations to keep room availability accurate.  
Sprint Duration: 2 weeks  
Team: Product Owner (Mapps), Scrum Master (Self), Development Team (Romeo, Bob, Evan)  
Date: 15 January 2026  

## Executive Summary
This sprint focused on delivering core conference room booking functionality for employees.  
The primary booking flow was successfully delivered, while filtering and management features were only partially completed.  
Dependencies and UI integration challenges required scope adjustment during the sprint, resulting in some work being deferred.  
Overall delivery confidence is moderate going into Sprint 2.

## What Was Delivered
- **Story #1 – Basic room booking:** Employees can view available rooms, confirm bookings, and see their bookings saved successfully.  
- **Story #3 – Room capacity filtering:** Employees can filter rooms by seating capacity for standard use cases.

## Incomplete or Deferred Work
- **Story #4 – Booking cancellation:** UI integration and automated testing were not completed within the sprint.  
- **Story #5 – Room equipment requirements:** Backend API was completed, but frontend integration and multi-select filtering logic remain incomplete.

## Key Blockers and Constraints
- Dependencies on Story #1 delayed progress on cancellation and equipment-related stories.  
- UI integration required more effort than initially estimated.  
- Late discovery of filtering and validation edge cases reduced available testing time.

## Metrics Snapshot
- Planned Story Points: 13  
- Completed Story Points: 8  
- Actual Velocity: 8  

## Delivery Confidence for Sprint 2
Medium  

**Rationale:**  
The core booking flow is stable and usable; however, earlier validation of dependencies, UI effort, and edge cases is needed to improve predictability and delivery confidence in the next sprint.
